# LSQ-Net: Learned Step Size Quantization

## Introduction

LSQ+ was implemented by eferring to the code in the link below

https://github.com/ZouJiu1/LSQplus

## Code Modulation

We modulate the code 

======== LSQ+ implementation ========
1) ./quan/utils.py
2) ./quan/quantizer/lsq.py
3) ./quan/quantizer/quantizer.py

================================


======== Execute LSQ+ ========
4) ./lsq_quantization.ipynb
